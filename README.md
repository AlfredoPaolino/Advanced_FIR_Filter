# Advanced_FIR_Filter
The goal of this project is to design a digital FIR filter with a cut-off frequency of 2 kHz, at first as Matlab/C reference models and then as a VHDL component.\
The architecture has been enhanced with the implementation of pipelining and 3-unfolding.\
When the design was ready, we followed the complete workflow for a digital component:\
-Simulation through Mentor Graphic’s QuestaSim\
-Logic synthesis through Synopsis Design Compiler\
-Place & Route through Cadence Innovus
